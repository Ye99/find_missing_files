# Project Structure for `find-missing-files`

This document outlines the directory and file structure for the `find-missing-files` Python CLI tool. The design emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and testability, adhering to standard Python project conventions.

## 1. Directory and File Layout

The project is organized into a source directory (`missing_file_finder`) and a test directory (`tests`), which is ideal for a Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

```
find-missing-files/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── missing_file_finder/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── cli.py
│   ├── core.py
│   └── utils.py
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_cli.py
    ├── test_core.py
    └── test_utils.py
```

## 2. Component Purpose

### Root Directory

*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to be ignored by Git (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, virtual environment directories).
*   **`README.md`**: Contains comprehensive project documentation, including a project overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and development guidelines.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python package dependencies required to run the project (e.g., `click` for the CLI).

### Source Directory (`missing_file_finder/`)

This is the main Python package containing the application's source code.

*   **`__init__.py`**: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package, allowing modules within it to be imported.
*   **`__main__.py`**: Provides the main entry point for executing the package as a script using the command `python -m missing_file_finder`. It imports and invokes the main function from `cli.py`.
*   **`cli.py`**: Manages the Command-Line Interface (CLI). It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments (like the subset and superset paths), handling user input, and displaying output.
*   **`core.py`**: Contains the core business logic of the application. This module implements the primary functionality: hashing files, performing the efficient O(1) hash map lookup, and identifying the missing files.
*   **`utils.py`**: Provides helper functions used across the application. A key utility here will be a file hashing function that streams large files to keep memory usage low.

### Test Directory (`tests/`)

This directory contains all the tests for the project, which is fundamental for the TDD approach.

*   **`__init__.py`**: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
*   **`test_cli.py`**: Contains unit tests for the CLI logic in `cli.py`. These tests ensure that command-line arguments are parsed correctly and that the CLI interacts with the core logic as expected.
*   **`test_core.py`**: Contains unit and integration tests for the business logic in `core.py`. These tests cover file discovery, hash comparison, and the correct identification of missing files under various scenarios.
*   **`test_utils.py`**: Contains unit tests for the helper functions in `utils.py`, such as verifying the correctness of the file hashing implementation.
